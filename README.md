#  Code Insight Analyzer
A Java-based static code analysis tool that evaluates source code quality using structure detection, cyclomatic complexity analysis, and a rule-based scoring engine.

This project simulates the core idea behind real-world tools like SonarQube, ESLint, and PMD in a simplified form.

---

#  What This Project Does
Code Insight Analyzer reads a Java source file and generates a detailed report including:

- 📄 Total lines of code
- 🏗️ Number of classes and methods
- 💬 Comment ratio analysis
- 🧠 Cyclomatic complexity calculation
- 📊 Code density measurement
- 🧮 Final quality score (/100)
- 💡 Improvement suggestions

#  Key Features

## 🔹 1. Code Parsing Engine
- Detects classes, methods, comments, and blank lines
- Performs lightweight structural analysis

## 🔹 2. Cyclomatic Complexity Analysis
- Measures decision-based complexity using:
  - if / else if
  - for / while loops
  - switch cases
  - logical operators (&&, ||)
- Provides real complexity estimation (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)

## 🔹 3. Metrics Engine
- Computes:
  - Comment ratio
  - Code density
  - Complexity level
  - Structural statistics

## 🔹 4. Scoring System
- Generates a final score out of 100
- Applies penalties for:
  - High complexity
  - Low comments
  - Large file size
- Provides quality rating:
  - EXCELLENT
  - GOOD
  - AVERAGE
  - POOR

## 🔹 5. Suggestion Engine
- Gives improvement recommendations such as:
  - Reduce method complexity
  - Add comments
  - Split large files
